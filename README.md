# Campus Placement
 Me and my team are trying to build a model to find out, based on the dataset "**Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv**", whether a student gets placed or not based on his/her credentials.
 
 Team consisted of the following members:
 1. Anish Sunil
 2. Preethika K
 3. Sneha Sujit Saha
 4. Kevin Thomas
 
In the project we started we doing the exploratory data analysis and visualization of the dataset and inferred certain conclusions from the graph.
In our project we used 5 supervised models to determine whether a student gets placed or not and find out which one has the highest accuracy and to determine the tier of the placed studentâ€™s salary in order to predict this value beforehand for new students based on their academic performance. Also to determine if there exists some form of 
gender bias in the recruitment process.

#### The following modules is been used for the project and the programming language is python

**i) Pandas :** Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks.

**ii)numpy :** general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

**iii)matplotlib.pyplot :** cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.

**iv)seaborn:** open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

**v)sklearn :** most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python to design models.

**vi)statistics :** built-in module that you can use to calculate mathematical statistics of numeric data
